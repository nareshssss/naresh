    <h1>INDIA'S TOP 3 MEDICINAL PLANTS</h1>
      <hr>
    <p><h2>1) Tulasi:</h2>
        One of the most common plants found widely in the homes of many Indians. Your Elders consider this plant as sacred and often feed you with Tulsi leaves.
         Also known as Holi Basil, Hindus regard this plant as an incarnation of Goddess Vrinda an avatar of Goddess Lakshmi and thus believed to bring in good luck and comfort into the home.

         Tulsi is the most common plant in every Indian home
         Apart from religious believes, Tulasi leaves are rich in antioxidants and also exhibit anti-fungal properties. The antioxidant-rich species is found to be widely used in herbal teas, beauty products and also medicines to fight Indigestion, diabetes, fever, cold, cough and bronchitis. These are different varieties of Tulsi
         
         Pro Tip: Eating 2-3 Tulasi leaves every day is quite beneficial for one’s health and also helps in stress-relieving and detoxifying body cells.
          Avoid chewing raw leaves instead, boil them in water and directly swallow it.</p>
          <h2> 2) Aloe Vera:</h2>
One such Ayurvedic shrub which doesn’t require much introduction, Aloe Vera is a quite commonly found stemmy shrub in every household and neighborhood. Aloe gel which is used across many medicines and a lot of beauty and facial products is derived from the leaves of Aloe Vera shrub. This species has been in the market for decades and is now a very popular shrub above all.
Aloe Vera does exhibit some antioxidant and antimicrobial properties and also helps in combating Constipation, Ulcers, Irritative Lower Bowel Syndrome(IBS) and also helps maintain blood sugar levels. Aloe gel is quite commonly used in Tooth gels, Mouthwashes, and many food flavoring agents.
          </p>
          <p>Aloe vera has many active ingredients and minerals that can help strengthen your hair. It has fatty acids and amino acids and is rich in vitamins A, B12, C, and E. These play a part in healthy hair follicles.
            It’s beneficial for many skin problems like wounds, acne, and burns. Aloe vera is also consumed as food and in drinks and may have benefits for inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, hepatitis, and more.
    But there have been few scientific studies on its effects on hair. Research on its benefits, in general, has been mixed. But this may be because it has so many properties and active ingredients. The varied effects of aloe vera may be due to the combination of chemicals and active ingredients.
        </p>
        3) NEEM</h2>
          <p>The medicinal utilities have been described especially for neem leaf. Neem leaf and its constituents have been demonstrated to exhibit immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycaemic, antiulcer, antimalarial, antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties.
            Leaf meals from some tropical legumes have been explored due to the need to look for alternative sources of food for humans and feed for livestock. Neem leaf meal was analysed in a study that found that it has 18.10% crude protein and relatively high crude fibre of about 15-56%. Though the  gross energy content was high at 4.16 kcal/g, the metabolizable energy is low
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost every part of the neem tree is used in traditional medicine (eg, Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Amchi) in many countries, with some 700 preparations described. The stem, root bark, and young fruits are used as a tonic and astringent, and the bark has been used as an analgesic and to treat malaria and cutaneous diseases. The tender leaves have been used in the treatment of worm infections, ulcers, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as in the treatment of leprosy. Indian farmers have used the leaves for hundreds of years as a pesticide and insect repellent.

          <h1>JAPAN TOP 3 MEDICINAL PLANTS</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>1) Calendula (キンセンカ)</h2>
    <p>
        Calendula officinalis, the pot marigold, common marigold, ruddles, Mary's gold or Scotch marigold,[2] is a flowering plant in the daisy family Asteraceae. It is probably native to southern Europe, though its long history of cultivation makes its precise origin unknown, and it may possibly be of garden origin.[clarification needed] It is also widely naturalised farther north in Europe (as far as southern England) and elsewhere in warm temperate regions of the world
    </p>
    <p>Calendula officinalis is widely cultivated and can be grown easily in sunny locations in most kinds of soils. Although perennial, it is commonly treated as an annual, particularly in colder regions where its winter survival is poor, and in hot summer locations where it also does not survive.


        Seeds of Calendula officinalis
        Calendulas are considered by many gardening experts as among the easiest and most versatile flowers to grow in a garden, especially because they tolerate most soils. In temperate climates, seeds are sown in spring for blooms that last throughout the summer and well into the fall. In areas of limited winter freezing, seeds are sown in autumn for winter color. Plants will wither in subtropical summer. Seeds will germinate freely in sunny or half-sunny locations, but plants do best if planted in sunny locations with rich, well-drained soil. Pot marigolds typically bloom quickly from seed (in under two months) in bright yellows, golds, and oranges.
        
        Leaves are spirally arranged, 5–18 cm (2–7 in) long, simple, and slightly hairy. The flower heads range from pastel yellow to deep orange, and are 3–7 cm (1+1⁄4–2+3⁄4 in) across, with both ray florets and disc florets. Most cultivars have a spicy aroma. It is recommended to deadhead (remove dying flower heads) the plants regularly to maintain even blossom production.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>2)  Shiso (しそ, 紫蘇)</h2>
        <p>
            Shiso  has a distinctive flavor that combines the aromas of citrus, mint, basil, anise, and coriander. Its red and green leaves are the main ingredients in sushi, sashimi, soups, and tempuras. You can also add it to salads, green tea, stir-fries, and scrambled eggs.
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>Several forms of shiso exist.[28] They are defined by the color and morphology of the leaves, though coloring is also found on the stalk and flower buds. Redness in shiso is caused by shisonin, an anthocyanin pigment found in perilla.[29] Ruffled red shiso was the first form examined by Western botanists, and Carl Peter Thunberg named it P. crispa (meaning "wavy" or "curly"). That Latin name crispa was later retained when shiso was reclassified as a cultigen.
                Red shiso (f. purpurea)
            Leaves red on both sides, flat surface. Often called simply "shiso".
            Ruffled red shiso (f. crispa)
            Leaves red on both sides, ruffled surface.
            Green shiso (f. viridis)
            Leaves green on both sides, flat surface.
            Ruffled green shiso (f. viridi-crispa)
            Leaves green on both sides, ruffled surface. Cultivar.
            Bicolor shiso (f. discolor)
            Leaves green on top side, red on back side, flat surface. Cultivar.
            Variegated shiso (f. rosea)
            Leaves a mix of green and red on both sides, flat surface.</p>
                    </div>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>3) Mitsuba (三つ葉)</h2>
                    <P>It looks like flat-leaf parsley, has a clean “green” flavor like parsley, belongs to the same family (Apiaceae) as parsley and is sometimes called wild Japanese parsley, but mitsuba (Cryptotaenia japonica) is a distinct herb that’s often used in Japanese and Chinese cooking.</P>
                    <p>
                        t looks like flat-leaf parsley, has a clean “green” flavor like parsley, belongs to the same family (Apiaceae) as parsley and is sometimes called wild Japanese parsley, but mitsuba (Cryptotaenia japonica) is a distinct herb that’s often used in Japanese and Chinese cooking.
                        Mitsuba means “three leaves” in Japanese and refers to the way the leaves grow on tall, skinny stems — very similar to my Giant of Italy parsley. The trefoil leaves are large and tender, with a subtle flavor that I can only describe as a cross of parsley, celery, and maybe a hint of cilantro.

                    <h1>AUSTRALI TOP 3 MEDICINAL PLANTS</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>1)Acacia falcata </h2>
    <p>
        Acacia falcata, commonly known as sickle wattle and by other vernacular names including sally,[2] is a perennial shrub or tree native to eastern Australia, which reaches five metres in height and has cream flowers in early winter. It gets its common and scientific name for its sickle-shaped leaves. Hardy and adaptable to cultivation, it is used in regeneration of bushland.
    </p>
    <p>
        Acacia falcata is adaptable to a wide range of soils in cultivation, and its attractive foliage is a horticultural feature.[6] It is propagated by seed which must be pretreated with boiling water before it is able to germinate. It is easy to grow given a good sunlit position and good drainage, and is used in revegetation.[11]

Australian indigenous people use the bark to make a liniment for treating ailments of the skin.[12] A. falcata is excellent for stabilizing barren sand. The bark is important in the tanning industry.[13]

The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia’ records that common names included "Hickory" and "Sally" and that Indigenous Australians of the Cumberland and Camden areas of New South Wales referred to it as "Weetjellan" It also notes that "This bark, which contains much tannin, was used by the Aboriginals [sic.] of the counties of Cumberland and Camden to stupefy fish, and to make embrocations for the cure of cutaneous diseases.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>2)Acacia salicina.</h2>
     <p>
        Acacia salicina is a thornless species of Acacia tree native to Australia.

It is a large shrub or small evergreen[2] tree growing up to 13.7m (45 feet) tall. Fast grower dropping lots of leaf litter. It has a life span of about 10–50 years. In the Northern Hemisphere, Acacia salicina flowers primarily from October to January and the seed pods are often visible from April to July.[3] The tree's seeds are shiny, black and have a crimson appendage-like aril.[4] Acacia salicina is "closely related" to Acacia ligulata[5] and Acacia bivenosa.
     </p>
     <p>
        Acacia salicina is found parts of Eastern Australia. The average yearly precipitation over the entire range is 375-550mm, with the plant itself found growing in regions receiving in excess of 1500mm annually in northern Queensland and as low as 100mm annually in central Australia. Its natural altitude range is from 50-300m above sea level.[4] It does well in full sun exposure and it tolerates frosts down to -6.7 deg. 
     </p>
     <hr>
     <h2>3)Nurseries</h2>
     <P>
        We specialise in sourcing and growing rare, unusual and hard to propagate plants, both native and exotic. We also conduct plant propagation research and breeding of native and novel horticultural crops. We welcome collaborations with industry and growers.

As our interests change, you will find a continually changing product list. Often we stock products just once, others that we are researching for longer periods will be continuously available. We suggest that if you see something in stock you’ve been after, then grab it while it’s available!
     </P>
     <p>
        Australian native plants are slowly becoming appreciated for their complex and unusual chemical and medicinal properties, as well as their potential as climate adaptable breeding stock for conventional foods and also as novel foods, spices and flavourings in their own right. As such, we hope to be able to provide a range of interesting Australian medicinal and native food species in the future as our understanding of them increases.

    <p>
        A. sinensis is the root of A. sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (Umbelliferae family).
         The genus Angelica is comprised of over 90 species, a total of 45 angelica species are currently distributed in China, of which 32 are endemic [1].
          It is mainly cultivated in the southeastern parts of Gansu Province, occurring in Yunnan, Sichuan, Shaanxi and Hubei and showing strong ecological adaptability at altitudes of 1500–2000 m above sea level in China. 
          Photographs of A. sinensis are shown in Figure 1. As a perennial herb, A. sinensis grows to heights of approximately 0.4–1 m (Flora of China). The whole root is yellowish-brown to brown, about 25 cm long, and irregularly cylindrical with some branch roots stemming from the lower end. The leaves have alternating ovate blades that can range in size between 8 and 18 cm long and 15–20 cm wide. The fruit is elliptical to ovate, and the flowers have 4–7 cm long stems and compound umbels
          A. sinensis has been used for thousands of years as a health food and drug in Asian countries and also as a dietary supplement in women’s care in Europe. In China, the roots of A. sinensis have been extensively used in traditional medicine and have been primarily used for treatment of gynecological disease such as dysmenorrhea and amenorrhea and blood disease such as blood deficiency [10]. Modern pharmacological research indicated that A. sinensis also exerted pharmacological activities of anticancer, neuroprotective effect [11], antioxidant [12], hepatoprotective effect [13], radioprotection [14], immunoregulation [15], anti-inflammatory [16], antifungal effects and mosquito deterrence

(A. membranaceus) or A. membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao. A. membranaceus and A. membranaceus var. mongholicus are mainly grown in Northwest China as well as in Mongolia and Korea, and they have some different botanical characteristics.

A. membranaceus var. mongholicus is a perennial herb, 50–150 cm high, with a straight, long and cylindrical root, measuring 20–50 cm, diameter 1–3.5 cm. Its stems are erect, with branches in the upper part, and are quilted with pubescence. It has an odd-pinnate, alternate, petiole base with lanceolate stipules, 25–37 leaflets, elliptical small leaves 4–9 mm long, and apex with long white pubescence. It has 10–25 flowers, racemes axillary, bracts linear-lanceolate, calyx tubular, calyx teeth—5, corolla yellow, butterfly, upper petal obovate triangular, glabrous, stamens—10, ovary stalked, ovate pods oblong, apex beaked, and significantly textured. The flowering period is from June to July, whereas fruiting is from August to September. It generally grows on hillsides, beside ditches, or in woodland and is found in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Tibet and other places.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally, R. astragali was regarded as a safe drug, no incidence of poisoning related with the use of R. astragali or its main active ingredients, has been reported in vivo or in vitro so far. It is determined that the LD50 of a crude extract of R. astragali is 40 g/kg using intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) in rats [39], and that did not show any adverse effects when raw herb was given to rats by lavage at the high dose 100 g/kg [40]. Moreover, the herbal extract (0.5 g/kg, i.p.) was injected to rats for 1 month, which caused no abnormal changes in food intake, urine/fecal production or behavior [41] Recently, the sub-chronic toxicity of the Astragalus extract, consisting of its active polysaccharides and saponins, has been evaluated the safety dosage range in clinical application. The application ranges 5.70–39.90 g/kg in rats, which are equivalent to 70 and 35 times in humans (0.57 g/kg, say, average body weight 70 kg), respectively

    <h2>2)Acorus calamus</h2>
    <p>
        Acorus calamus (also called sweet flag, sway or muskrat root, among many common names[3]) is a species of flowering plant with psychoactive chemicals. It is a tall wetland monocot of the family Acoraceae, in the genus Acorus. Although used in traditional medicine[4] over centuries to treat digestive disorders and pain, there is no clinical evidence for its safety or efficacy – and ingested calamus may be toxic – leading to its commercial ban in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sweet flag is a herbaceous perennial, 2 m (79 in) tall.[5] Its leaves resembles those of the iris family. Sweet flag consists of tufts of basal leaves that rise from a spreading rhizome.[5] The leaves are erect yellowish-brown, radical, with pink sheathing at their bases, sword-shaped, flat and narrow, tapering into a long, acute point, and have parallel veins. The leaves have smooth edges, which can be wavy or crimped. The sweet flag can be distinguished from iris and other similar plants by the crimped edges of the leaves, the fragrant odor it emits when crushed, and the presence of a spadix.[6][7]

Only plants that grow in water bear flowers. The solid, triangular flower-stems rise from the axils of the outer leaves. A semi-erect spadix emerges from one side of the flower stem. The spadix is solid, cylindrical, tapers at each end, and is 5 to 10 cm in length. A covering spathe, as is usual with Araceae, is absent. The spadix is densely crowded with tiny greenish-yellow flowers. Each flower contains six petals and stamens enclosed in a perianth with six divisions, surrounding a three-celled, oblong ovary with a sessile stigma. The flowers are sweetly fragrant.[6][7] In Europe, it flowers for about a month in late spring or early summer, but does not bear fruit. The fruit is a berry filled with mucus, which when ripe falls into the water and disperses by floating. In Asia, it also fruits sparingly, and propagates itself mainly by growth of its rhizome, forming colonies.

    <h2>3)Pitaya</h2>
    <p>
        Hylocereus undatus (white pitaya) is an economically-important antioxidant-rich fruit. The fruit (Figure 3) is also rich in fiber and vitamins [31]. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and originated in the Americas [32]. Similarly, red-purple pitaya (Hylocereus polyrhizus) is also very rich in red-violet pigments known as betacyanins which offer health-promoting effects and protective benefits against degenerative diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, heart diseases, and obesity [33]. The white-flesh of H. undatus fruits with its red peel have characteristics sensorial properties as well as huge economic importance. Both the pulps and peels of H. undatus are very rich in antioxidants, fiber, vitamins, free from toxic and thus safe for consumption as well other medicinal uses for the treatment of degenerative diseases such as arteriosclerosis, arthritis, brain dysfunction, cancer, diabetes, inflammation, and heart diseases [31]. The seed oil of H. undatus and H. polyrhizus are also rich in linoleic, oleic, and palmitic acids, in addition to other phytosterol compounds (such as campesterol, cholesterol, stigmasterol, and β-sitosterol) and phenolic acid compounds (such as caffeic, gallic, protocatechuic, p-coumaric, p-hydroxybenzoic, syringic and vanillic acids) [34]. The remarkable antibacterial activity of both H. undatus and H. polyrhizus is attributed to their presence of various antioxidant compounds and essential fatty acids such as linoleic and linolenic acids [35]. The essential oils of H. undatus fruits have outstanding antifungal activity
