    <h1>JAPAN TOP 3 MEDICINAL PLANTS</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>1) Calendula (キンセンカ)</h2>
    <p>
        Calendula officinalis, the pot marigold, common marigold, ruddles, Mary's gold or Scotch marigold,[2] is a flowering plant in the daisy family Asteraceae. It is probably native to southern Europe, though its long history of cultivation makes its precise origin unknown, and it may possibly be of garden origin.[clarification needed] It is also widely naturalised farther north in Europe (as far as southern England) and elsewhere in warm temperate regions of the world

    <p>Calendula officinalis is widely cultivated and can be grown easily in sunny locations in most kinds of soils. Although perennial, it is commonly treated as an annual, particularly in colder regions where its winter survival is poor, and in hot summer locations where it also does not survive.


        Seeds of Calendula officinalis
        Calendulas are considered by many gardening experts as among the easiest and most versatile flowers to grow in a garden, especially because they tolerate most soils. In temperate climates, seeds are sown in spring for blooms that last throughout the summer and well into the fall. In areas of limited winter freezing, seeds are sown in autumn for winter color. Plants will wither in subtropical summer. Seeds will germinate freely in sunny or half-sunny locations, but plants do best if planted in sunny locations with rich, well-drained soil. Pot marigolds typically bloom quickly from seed (in under two months) in bright yellows, golds, and oranges.
        
        Leaves are spirally arranged, 5–18 cm (2–7 in) long, simple, and slightly hairy. The flower heads range from pastel yellow to deep orange, and are 3–7 cm (1+1⁄4–2+3⁄4 in) across, with both ray florets and disc florets. Most cultivars have a spicy aroma. It is recommended to deadhead (remove dying flower heads) the plants regularly to maintain even blossom production.</p>

        <h2>2)  Shiso (しそ, 紫蘇)</h2>
        <p>
            Shiso  has a distinctive flavor that combines the aromas of citrus, mint, basil, anise, and coriander. Its red and green leaves are the main ingredients in sushi, sashimi, soups, and tempuras. You can also add it to salads, green tea, stir-fries, and scrambled eggs.

            <p>Several forms of shiso exist.[28] They are defined by the color and morphology of the leaves, though coloring is also found on the stalk and flower buds. Redness in shiso is caused by shisonin, an anthocyanin pigment found in perilla.[29] Ruffled red shiso was the first form examined by Western botanists, and Carl Peter Thunberg named it P. crispa (meaning "wavy" or "curly"). That Latin name crispa was later retained when shiso was reclassified as a cultigen.
    Red shiso (f. purpurea)
Leaves red on both sides, flat surface. Often called simply "shiso".
Ruffled red shiso (f. crispa)
Leaves red on both sides, ruffled surface.
Green shiso (f. viridis)
Leaves green on both sides, flat surface.
Ruffled green shiso (f. viridi-crispa)
Leaves green on both sides, ruffled surface. Cultivar.
Bicolor shiso (f. discolor)
Leaves green on top side, red on back side, flat surface. Cultivar.
Variegated shiso (f. rosea)
Leaves a mix of green and red on both sides, flat surface.</p>

        <h2>3) Mitsuba (三つ葉)</h2>
        <P>It looks like flat-leaf parsley, has a clean “green” flavor like parsley, belongs to the same family (Apiaceae) as parsley and is sometimes called wild Japanese parsley, but mitsuba (Cryptotaenia japonica) is a distinct herb that’s often used in Japanese and Chinese cooking.</P>

        <p>
            t looks like flat-leaf parsley, has a clean “green” flavor like parsley, belongs to the same family (Apiaceae) as parsley and is sometimes called wild Japanese parsley, but mitsuba (Cryptotaenia japonica) is a distinct herb that’s often used in Japanese and Chinese cooking.
            Mitsuba means “three leaves” in Japanese and refers to the way the leaves grow on tall, skinny stems — very similar to my Giant of Italy parsley. The trefoil leaves are large and tender, with a subtle flavor that I can only describe as a cross of parsley, celery, and maybe a hint of cilantro.
