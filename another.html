    <p>Aloe vera has many active ingredients and minerals that can help strengthen your hair. It has fatty acids and amino acids and is rich in vitamins A, B12, C, and E. These play a part in healthy hair follicles.
        It’s beneficial for many skin problems like wounds, acne, and burns. Aloe vera is also consumed as food and in drinks and may have benefits for inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, hepatitis, and more.
But there have been few scientific studies on its effects on hair. Research on its benefits, in general, has been mixed. But this may be because it has so many properties and active ingredients. The varied effects of aloe vera may be due to the combination of chemicals and active ingredients.

          <h2>3) NEEM</h2>

Neem leaf and its constituents have been demonstrated to exhibit immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycaemic, antiulcer, antimalarial, antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties.
            Leaf meals from some tropical legumes have been explored due to the need to look for alternative sources of food for humans and feed for livestock. Neem leaf meal was analysed in a study that found that it has 18.10% crude protein and relatively high crude fibre of about 15-56%. Though the  gross energy content was high at 4.16 kcal/g, the metabolizable energy is low
