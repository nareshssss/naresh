    <h1>AUSTRALI TOP 3 MEDICINAL PLANTS</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>1)Acacia falcata </h2>
    <p>
        Acacia falcata, commonly known as sickle wattle and by other vernacular names including sally,[2] is a perennial shrub or tree native to eastern Australia, which reaches five metres in height and has cream flowers in early winter. It gets its common and scientific name for its sickle-shaped leaves. Hardy and adaptable to cultivation, it is used in regeneration of bushland.

    <p>
        Acacia falcata is adaptable to a wide range of soils in cultivation, and its attractive foliage is a horticultural feature.[6] It is propagated by seed which must be pretreated with boiling water before it is able to germinate. It is easy to grow given a good sunlit position and good drainage, and is used in revegetation.[11]

Australian indigenous people use the bark to make a liniment for treating ailments of the skin.[12] A. falcata is excellent for stabilizing barren sand. The bark is important in the tanning industry.[13]

The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia’ records that common names included "Hickory" and "Sally" and that Indigenous Australians of the Cumberland and Camden areas of New South Wales referred to it as "Weetjellan" It also notes that "This bark, which contains much tannin, was used by the Aboriginals [sic.] of the counties of Cumberland and Camden to stupefy fish, and to make embrocations for the cure of cutaneous diseases.

    <h2>2)Acacia salicina.</h2>
     <p>
        Acacia salicina is a thornless species of Acacia tree native to Australia.

It is a large shrub or small evergreen[2] tree growing up to 13.7m (45 feet) tall. Fast grower dropping lots of leaf litter. It has a life span of about 10–50 years. In the Northern Hemisphere, Acacia salicina flowers primarily from October to January and the seed pods are often visible from April to July.[3] The tree's seeds are shiny, black and have a crimson appendage-like aril.[4] Acacia salicina is "closely related" to Acacia ligulata[5] and Acacia bivenosa.

     <p>
        Acacia salicina is found parts of Eastern Australia. The average yearly precipitation over the entire range is 375-550mm, with the plant itself found growing in regions receiving in excess of 1500mm annually in northern Queensland and as low as 100mm annually in central Australia. Its natural altitude range is from 50-300m above sea level.[4] It does well in full sun exposure and it tolerates frosts down to -6.7 deg.

     <h2>3)Nurseries</h2>
     <P>
        We specialise in sourcing and growing rare, unusual and hard to propagate plants, both native and exotic. We also conduct plant propagation research and breeding of native and novel horticultural crops. We welcome collaborations with industry and growers.

As our interests change, you will find a continually changing product list. Often we stock products just once, others that we are researching for longer periods will be continuously available. We suggest that if you see something in stock you’ve been after, then grab it while it’s available!
     </P>

     <p>
        Australian native plants are slowly becoming appreciated for their complex and unusual chemical and medicinal properties, as well as their potential as climate adaptable breeding stock for conventional foods and also as novel foods, spices and flavourings in their own right. As such, we hope to be able to provide a range of interesting Australian medicinal and native food species in the future as our understanding of them increases.
